# html-tips-tricks

`HTML5` is not a new thing. We have been using several features of it since its initial release(October 2014). As part of the `#100DaysOfCode` initiative, I have taken time out to revisit the feature list again. See what I found? I haven't really used a bunch of it!

In this repo, I am listing down such `HTML5` features that I haven't used much but, found useful. I have also created a working example flow and hosted it on netlify. Hope you find it useful.
